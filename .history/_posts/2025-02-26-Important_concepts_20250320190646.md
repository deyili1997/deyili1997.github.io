Contrastive learning:  
Graph diffusion:  
Deep InfoMax:  
Inductive task:  
Transductive task:  
Weisfeiler-Lehman test:  
Discrete-Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs): The graph is considered static within each time step, and edges/nodes can change only at discrete time points.  
Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs): Changes (edges and nodes) occur at arbitrary timestamps, not at fixed intervals. Typically represented as a sequence of time-stamped events, often modeled as a temporal point process.  
Random walk:  
Non-isomorphic distance-regular graphs:  
Low-rank linear Transformers:  
Pretext tasks: Auxiliary tasks designed to help a model learn useful feature representations in a self-supervised learning setting. These tasks create a structured learning objective that forces the model to extract meaningful patterns from data without requiring labeled annotations.
Momentum update:
