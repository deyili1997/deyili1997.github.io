Many learning tasks require handling graph data, which contains rich relational information among elements. Applications such as modeling physical systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interfaces, and classifying diseases necessitate models capable of learning from graph inputs. Additionally, in domains dealing with non-structured data like text and images, reasoning over extracted structures, such as dependency trees in sentences and scene graphs in images, is a crucial research area that also relies on graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models designed to capture dependencies in graphs through message passing between nodes. In recent years, various GNN architectures, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Recurrent Networks (GRN), have achieved groundbreaking performance in numerous deep learning tasks. This survey introduces a general design pipeline for GNN models, explores the variants of each component, systematically categorizes their applications, and highlights four open challenges for future research.
