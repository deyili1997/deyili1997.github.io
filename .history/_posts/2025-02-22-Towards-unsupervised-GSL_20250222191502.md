The authors present graph neural networks (GNNs) as a powerful tool for various graph-related applications but highlight their vulnerability to noisy connections in original graph structures and their dependency on explicit structures, which limits their applicability to unstructured scenarios. To address these challenges, they discuss deep graph structure learning (GSL) methods that jointly optimize graph structures with GNNs under the supervision of a node classification task; however, they note that existing methods suffer from reliance on labels, edge distribution bias, and limitations on application tasks. In response, the authors propose a more practical paradigm, unsupervised graph structure learning (GSL), where the learned graph topology is optimized solely by the data itself without external guidance. They introduce StrUcture Bootstrapping contrastive LearnIng fraMEwork (SUBLIME), a novel approach that incorporates self-supervised contrastive learning by generating an “anchor graph” from the original data and applying contrastive loss to maximize agreement between the anchor graph and the learned graph. To ensure continuous improvement, they design a bootstrapping mechanism that updates the anchor graph with learned structures during training, along with various graph learners and post-processing schemes to model structural learning effectively. Through extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets, the authors demonstrate the significant effectiveness of SUBLIME and the high quality of the optimized graphs.
