In this survey, the authors explore Tabular Data Learning (TDL) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a field where deep learning methods have demonstrated superior performance over traditional approaches in classification and regression tasks. Despite these advancements, a critical gap remains: the underrepresentation of latent correlations among data instances and feature values in deep neural TDL methods. GNNs, with their ability to model complex relationships within tabular data, have gained significant traction across various TDL applications. The authors provide a systematic review of GNNs for TDL (GNN4TDL), covering fundamental principles, an overview of existing methodologies, and a structured taxonomy of graph construction and representation learning techniques. Furthermore, the survey examines diverse training strategies, emphasizing auxiliary tasks that enhance instance representations, and discusses real-world applications that highlight the versatility of GNNs in TDL. Finally, the authors address key challenges, propose future research directions, and present this survey as a resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to drive innovation in GNN4TDL.
